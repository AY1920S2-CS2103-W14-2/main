== PROJECT: Inventory Manager

== Overview
InventoryManager is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their inventory. More importantly, InventoryManager is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InventoryManager can get your inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Buy and Sell commands*
** What it does: Allows users to `buy` and `sell` batches of goods. The commands orchestrate the
interaction between the Inventory, Supplier List, and Transaction History to
validate the input and update the model properly, or notify the user otherwise.

** Justification: This is the main functionality of the Inventory Manager, which is
to keep stock, and manage all changes to, all goods currently in inventory.
`buy` and `sell` commands accomplish exactly that.

** Highlights: This feature touched upon all aspects of the `Model`. It required
supplier information and inventory status to perform input validation to update
the inventory. Then it creates a new transaction history record.
*** Since the `buy` and `sell` commands are the main avenue that our program takes
input from the user, the required parameters would form the basis of other
commands, especially profit analytics and historical analysis extensions.
As such, it was a challenge to ensure that it was as extensible as possible
because it was expected to change frequently with additional commands.
*** A total of 3 extensions were needed to `buy` and `sell` commands and their related tests.

*** As `buy` and `sell` commands needed to assess all the models of persistent
storage, the development of this feature also shaped the storage design and API
of the underlying model to facilitate maximum assess without violating
encapsulation principles.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added ability to delete a good entry from inventory.
