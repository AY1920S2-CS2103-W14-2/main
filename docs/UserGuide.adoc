== Introduction

InventoryManager is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their inventory*. More importantly, InventoryManager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InventoryManager can get your inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `inventorymanager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your InventoryManager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. For Mac OS users, permission may need to be granted to the file before usage.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list-s`* : lists all suppliers
* **`add`**`n/John Doe c/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 gp/apple 4.50` : adds a supplier named `John Doe` selling apples at 4.50 each to the InventoryManager.
* **`delete-s 3`** : deletes the 3rd supplier shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
